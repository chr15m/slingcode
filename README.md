Slingcode is a personal computing platform in a single html file.

 * You can make, run, and share web apps with it.
 * You don't need any complicated tools to use it, just a web browser.
 * You can put it on a web site, run it from a USB stick, laptop, or phone, and it doesn't need an internet connection to work.
 * You can "add to home screen" in your device's browser to easily access your library of programs on the go.

[Try Slingcode online](https://slingcode.net/slingcode.html) or right-click and "save link as" to [Download `slingcode.html`](https://slingcode.net/slingcode.html) on to your own computer.

> Your computer. Your software. Your data.

### Nostalgia

Remember when computers were fun? When a kid could type out a BASIC listing from a magazine and make magic with light and sound. When your computer belonged to you and you could understand the software running on it.

I'm trying to recreate that magic with Slingcode. To get rid of all the tooling and dependencies and hosting problems, and make coding fun again. To help you bridge the gap between your idea and running code.

I built it so I can teach my kids to code without all the complex setup you need now. I'm trying to re-create the simple environment I had when I learned to code with my Mum on the Apple IIe back in the 80s.

### Inspiration

> ...in the original visions of many personal computing pioneers... the PC was intended as personal property – the owner would have total control (and understanding) of the software running on the PC, including the ability to copy bits on the PC at will. Software complexity, Internet connectivity, and unresolved incentive mismatches between software publishers and users (PC owners) have substantially eroded the reality of the personal computer as personal property.
